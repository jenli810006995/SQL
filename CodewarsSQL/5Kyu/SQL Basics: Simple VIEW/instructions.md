For this challenge you need to create a VIEW. This VIEW is used by a sales store to give out vouches to members who have spent over $1000 in departments that have brought in more than $10000 total ordered by the members id. The VIEW must be called members_approved_for_voucher then you must create a SELECT query using the view.

Tables and relationship below:

resultant table schema

id
name
email
total_spending

NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.
